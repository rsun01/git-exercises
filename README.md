# Git Exercises

This repository contains the exercises to my git presentation. Look in answers.txt for
solutions on how to solve these problems.

## Simple Exercises

1. Fork the repository on Github.

2. Open the logs and figure out how many commits there are.

3. Create a file called p3.txt, add it, and commit it with a sensible message.

4. Push your change to your forked repo on github.

5. Reset the head so that the commit you just added is removed (in the future, don't do this after you've already pushed out a commit!).

## Branching

1. List all of the branches (remote and local)

2. Create a branch called advanced and make a commit on it. 

3. Push advanced out to a github repository. If this works, Github should say that you have 2 branches on your remote

4. Merge advanced with master

5. Delete advanced on both the local and remote repos.
